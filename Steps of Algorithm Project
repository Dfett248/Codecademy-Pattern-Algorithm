---input the pattern that's being searched for in the text--- (strikethrough)
--Enter-- (strikethrough) State the text
--Enter-- (strikethrough) State the pattern
Was every line of text searched?
  if no: then search the next line 
  if yes: was the pattern found?
Keep track of whether or not text contains a pattern with variable contains_pattern
Keep track of whether or not all characters of the pattern are found on each line of text with variable 
match_count
If all characters of the pattern are not found on --one-- (strikethrough) a line move to the next line 
  do this too if characters are not found on a line
  however: if a few characters are found put amount of characters in match_count
if all characters of the pattern are found on a line: 
  input amount of characters in variable match_count
if the pattern is found in the text set variable contains_pattern to TRUE
  otherwise: set variable contains_pattern to FALSE if the pattern is not found anywhere in the text
